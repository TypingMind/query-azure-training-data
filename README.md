# Query Training Data from Azure AI Search (Cognitive Search)

This plugin connects TypingMind to your training data in Azure AI Search (Cognitive Search).

When the user ask the AI a question but the AI does not have the answer, the AI will query the training data in Azure AI Search to find the answer.

To use this plugin, you need to have an Azure AI Search service and an index with training data.

To get started with Azure AI Search, follow the [official documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/search-what-is-azure-search).
